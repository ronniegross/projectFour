# Project Four

## Description

* Use React as a front-end framework.
* Have at least 3 models. 
* Have full CRUD on at least one of your models.
* Be able to Add/Delete on any remaining models.
* Include a 3rd Party API.
* You must explicitly write the 3rd Party API calls in your app. Installing an npm package that includes API calls will not meet the requirements.
* Have high quality code.
* Be deployed on Heroku.

## Goal

The goal of this project was to create an easy to use application to assist Atlanta's homeless community in finding shelter and community. Mobile responsiveness was the top priority as most homeless folks have access to a smart phone, which would allow them to easily utilize a web application.

## Final Thoughts
* I'm really proud of the function I created to alphabetically sort the resources by their resource_name.
* This has been my passion project, and it was inspired by research I did during my senior year at Georgia Tech. I am planning on continuing to develop and refine this app after this bootcamp ends.
